			<h2>HippUnfold</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/khanlab/hippunfold">HippUnfold</a> is a software application designed to work with high-resolution MRI images of the hippocampus. It leverages prior knowledge about hippocampal shape and ontogeny to provide accurate and reliable measurements of hippocampal volume and shape.</p>
			<p>The software was developed by Dr. Jordan DeKraker during their PhD at Western University along with Dr Ali Khan. It is now being maintained and extended by Jordan at McGill University and Ali at Western University.</p>

			<h2>HippUnfold Toolbox</h2>
			<p><a href="https://github.com/jordandekraker/hippunfold_toolbox">HippUnfold Toolbox</a> is a set of MATLAB and Python examples meant to show users of HippUnfold how to carry out more sophisticated analyses using HippUnfold. This includes custom code for mapping DWI and fMRI data, as well as surface-based second-level analyses. </p>
			<p>The software was developed by Dr. Jordan DeKraker during their postdoctoral fellowship at McGill University.</p>
