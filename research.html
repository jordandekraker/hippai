            <li>The hippocampus, like the neocortex, is composed of a thin, folded tissue. This is often hard to appreciate in MRI with low resolution, or in histology where only one plane of view is available. Thus, instead of modelling the hippocampus as a "subcortical" nucleus, as in many other research software packages, I model the hippocampus as a 2D folded sheet. This topology provides constraints on image interpretation, and can help with technical  issues like subfield parcellation, inter-subject alignment, and making inferences about incomplete or low-resolution data.Read more <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016622362100117X" >here</a>. </li>
            <li>CTV News London interview alongside PhD supervisor Dr Ali Khan for our Trends in Neuroscience paper advocating the 2D folded geometry of the hippocampus as its primary organizing structure and the ideal basis for subfield parcellation. See the story <a href="https://london.ctvnews.ca/western-university-developed-technique-gives-new-insight-on-brain-disorders-1.5525280" >here</a>. </li>
            <li>‘Hippocampal subfields revealed through unfolding and unsupervised clustering of laminar and morphological features in 3D BigBrain’. Here, we manually delineated hippocampal folding structure and subfields in the fully 3D ground truth BigBrain histology dataset. We then computationally extracted morphological and laminar features within this folding configuration based on popular neocortical analysis methods. Unsupervised clustering of these hippocampal features revealed subdivisions which closely resembled ground truth subfield definitions. This highlights both the validity of subfield definitions, which remain contested both in MRI and in histology, as well as the sensitivity of the methods.
