            <p>Developed a software application `HippUnfold`, which leverages prior knowledge about hippocampal shape and ontogeny to optimize segmentation and morphological analysis. This was initially designed to work with some of the earliest/best 7T MRI images in Canada. Later, HippUnfold was made into a fully automated BIDS-App. that can span images from standard MRI resolutions (~1mm) to a microscopic/histology scale (~40um)</p>

            <li>CTV News London interview alongside PhD supervisor Dr Ali Khan for our Trends in Neuroscience paper advocating the 2D folded geometry of the hippocampus as its primary organizing structure and the ideal basis for subfield parcellation. https://london.ctvnews.ca/western-university-developed-technique-gives-new-insight-on-brain-disorders-1.5525280</li>
            <li>‘Hippocampal subfields revealed through unfolding and unsupervised clustering of laminar and morphological features in 3D BigBrain’ was a project that performed computational anatomy of histology on an unprecedented scale in the hippocampus. Briefly, we manually delineated hippocampal folding structure and subfields in the fully 3D ground truth BigBrain histology dataset. We then computationally extracted morphological and laminar features within this folding configuration based on popular neocortical analysis methods. Unsupervised clustering of these hippocampal features revealed subdivisions which closely resembled ground truth subfield definitions. This highlights both the validity of subfield definitions, which remain contested both in MRI and in histology, as well as the sensitivity of the methods developed here.
