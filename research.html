      <h1>Research Highlights</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Developed a software application called HippUnfold, which leverages prior knowledge about hippocampal shape and ontogeny to work with some of the earliest/best 7T MRI images in Canada. Later, HippUnfold was made into a fully automated BIDS-App.</li>
        <li>Examined hippocampal microstructure in BigBrain, performing histology-scale technical refinements to HippUnfold, and combining data across MRI, multimodal histology, fMRI, and iEEG.</li>
        <li>Studied rodent cognition with a focus on memory and navigation during undergrad at Carleton University, Ottawa.</li>
        <li>Investigated neuroimaging of the hippocampus and behavioural tests of pattern separation in major depressive disorder during masters in behavioural and cognitive psychology at Western University.</li>
        <li>Conducted PhD research in neuroscience at Western University, working with Dr Ali Khan and Dr Stefan Kohler.</li>
