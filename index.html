        <h1>Research overview</h1>
        <p>I am a postdoc at McGill University working on neuroimaging of the hippocampus. </p>
        <p>Surface-based analysis of the hippocampus + subfields in MRI and in histology is my main line of work. I've developed a great set of tools for this with state-of-the-art intersubject alignment on the order of 0.5mm! Some applications include examining inter-individual differences in hippocmapal morphometry and quantitative MRI, their correlates with cognition and overall health, and the hippocampus' selective vulnerabilities to diseases like depression and temporal lobe epilepsy. Get in touch if you're interested to collaborate.</p>
        <p>My future research program includes examination of analogies between hippocampal and AI memory systems. Specifically, I believe the hippocampus serves a fundamental role in organizing the neocortex through its extremely fast learning rate, and other special microstructural characteristics. Though some very interesting work has looked at similarities in visual object recognition between deep neural networks and the brain, and other parallels, relatively little work has examined parallels between the hippocampus and AI despite its widely recognized fundamental role in learning. Thus I believe our knowledge of hippocampal microcircuitry can help scaffold AI models and vice-versa in the future.</p>
