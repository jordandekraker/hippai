		<h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="img/headshot.JPG" alt="headshot" class="headshot-image">
		<p>I am a neuroscientist with expertise in MRI and cognitive psychology. My research interests include the neural basis of memory and navigation, the development of advanced MRI analysis techniques, and the application of these techniques to understanding brain disorders such as major depressive disorder and Alzheimer's disease.</p>
