            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="img/headshot.JPG" alt="headshot" class="headshot-image">
            <p>I believe learning and memory are critical for intelligence and consciousness. Since I first departed for university, this core philosophy has motivated me to dive into neuroscience and, especially, the hippocampus which is a key brain structure in learning and memory. My graduate work versed me in many technical problems around studying the hippocampus in humans, especially with neuroimaging. Now, with the advent of deep learning, I have developed methods for handling hippocampal imaging all the way from 3D MRI to the miscroscopic or histological level. Along the way, the utility of deep learning has been instrumental, but the theory itself also intrigues me as I now examine links between hippocampal and AI learning.</p>
